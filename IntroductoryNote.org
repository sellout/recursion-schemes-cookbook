#+title: A Note on Terminology

The terminology used around trees (starting with the word "trees") in software
is terribly inconsistent.

** needs some diagrams **
- a tree
- an org chart

In nature, trees grow up with roots at the bottom, but when we talk about
"bottom-up", that means "from the leaves toward the root", which is the opposite
of what "bottom" and "up" mean in nature.

The origins in top-down and bottom-up probably lie in organizational structure,
where there is a single CEO at "the top", and then a "branching" structure
through various levels of managers until you get individual contributors at the
"leaves".

To brush all of this aside, in this book we'll endeavor to use an
internally-consistent set of terms. We'll keep the tree metaphor (since it's so
strong in software), but lose the directionality. Instead, we'll say "leafward"
and "rootward" (mapping to "bottom-up" and "top-down, respectively").
